# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a customer segmentation analysis performed using KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main objective of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify distinct customer segments within the dataset.

## Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, EDA, PCA, and KMeans clustering.
  - `1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - `2_eda.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
  - `3_pca.ipynb`: Notebook for Principal Component Analysis.
  - `4_kmeans.ipynb`: Notebook for KMeans clustering.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
   ```
   cd customer-segmentation-analysis/notebooks
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
   - `1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `2_eda.ipynb`
